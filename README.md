# Ginger.io Public Repo
At [Ginger.io](http://ginger.io), we love writing code that makes life easier. Most of our code is written for our core business of helping detect and improve health problems. Occasionally we write code that isn't for our core business and that we believe would help make other engineers' lives easier.

Each directory in this repo is a separate project that we've decided to share with the public. We hope you'll find something useful.
